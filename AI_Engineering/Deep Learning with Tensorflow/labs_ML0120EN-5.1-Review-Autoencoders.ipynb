    "An autoencoder, also known as autoassociator or Diabolo networks, is an artificial neural network employed to recreate the given input.\n",
    "It takes a set of <b>unlabeled</b> inputs, encodes them and then tries to extract the most valuable information from them.\n",
    "They are used for feature extraction, learning generative models of data, dimensionality reduction and can be used for compression. \n",
